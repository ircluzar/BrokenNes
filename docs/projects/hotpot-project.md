# Hot Path JS ‚Üî WASM / CLR Boundary Optimization Project ("HotPot")

Date: 2025-08-19
Scope: BrokenNes (Blazor WASM NES emulator + SoundFont bridges)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Profiling + code inspection show our worst perf multipliers stem from (a) high-frequency, small-payload interop (`IJSRuntime.Invoke*` / `[JSInvokable]`) inside the frame + audio + note event loops and (b) redundant marshalling (arrays copied each boundary). Largest wins will come from eliminating per-event calls and moving bulk data via shared memory or batched codecs. This document lists concrete improvements ranked by estimated payoff vs effort.

### 1.1 Progress Snapshot (Updated 2025-08-19)
Implemented / prototyped since initial draft:
* ‚úÖ HOTPOT-02: Coalesced `presentFrame` unified JS call (see `Nes.razor` & `nesInterop.presentFrame`).
* üöß HOTPOT-04: AudioWorklet + SharedArrayBuffer ring prototype auto-inits on first audio buffer (fallback preserved).
* ‚ùå HOTPOT-05: Zero-copy framebuffer path (prototype removed / rolled back; legacy marshalled framebuffer restored as sole path).
* üöß HOTPOT-07: Partial async/state machine reduction (coalesced present reduces awaits; full ValueTask refactor pending).
* üîç Instrumentation: Basic audio diagnostics (`audioDiag`) & zero-copy enable logs present.

Not yet started / pending major work:
* ‚≠ï HOTPOT-01 Packed input bitmask (`UpdateInputPacked`).
* ‚≠ï HOTPOT-03 Note event batching (still per-event invokes).
* ‚≠ï HOTPOT-X1 Comprehensive interop call/byte counter decorator service.
* Finalization tasks for HOTPOT-04/05 (make new paths default + retire legacy paths where safe).

### 1.2 Updated Top 5 Remaining High-Leverage Improvements
1. HOTPOT-03 Note event batching (or shared memory polling) ‚Äì remove bursty micro invokes.
2. HOTPOT-01 Packed input bitmask (and optionally JS polling) ‚Äì shrink input marshaling & spikes.
3. HOTPOT-04 Complete SAB ring integration on .NET side; eliminate legacy per-frame audio buffer on supported browsers.
4. (Removed) HOTPOT-05 Zero-copy framebuffer promotion deferred indefinitely; feature rolled back.
5. HOTPOT-X1 Metrics + automated bench harness (X1 + X2) ‚Äì enables safe iteration & regression gating.

Runners-up: Finish HOTPOT-07 ValueTask refactor; consider HOTPOT-06 loop inversion only if inbound invoke remains material after above; HOTPOT-08 unmarshalled primitives if still justified post-batching.

## 2. Current Hot Boundaries (Simplified Map)

| Path | Direction | Frequency | Payload | Mechanism | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| `requestAnimationFrame` ‚Üí `[JSInvokable] FrameTick()` | JS‚Üí.NET | ~60 Hz | none | DotNetObjectRef invoke | Schedules whole emu frame.
| `RunFrame()` ‚Üí `JS.InvokeVoidAsync("nesInterop.playAudio", float[], rate)` | .NET‚ÜíJS | 60 Hz (variable) | Float32 samples (768‚Äì2048) | Marshalled array | Copies full audio buffer every frame.
| `RunFrame()` ‚Üí `JS.InvokeVoidAsync("nesInterop.drawFrame", framebuffer)` | .NET‚ÜíJS | 60 Hz | Full framebuffer (pixel array) | Marshalled array | Likely largest single copy per frame.
| APU note events (`noteCallback` ‚Üí `nesInterop.noteEvent`) | .NET‚ÜíJS | Potentially dozens‚Äìhundreds / sec (burst) | 5 small primitives | Individual async invokes | Each call alloc alloc + dispatch.
| Input updates (`initTouchController` touch moves ‚Üí `[JSInvokable] UpdateInput(bool[8])`) | JS‚Üí.NET | Variable (user) but can spike | bool[8] array | Marshalled array | Could pack into 1 byte.
| Shader registration loop (startup) | .NET‚ÜíJS | One-time | Many strings | OK (init only) | Not hot.
| IndexedDB get/set preferences | Both | Sporadic | Small string | Fine (not in tight loop).
| Save state chunk ops (`getStateChunk` etc.) | .NET‚ÜíJS | User triggered | Strings (base64) | OK unless very large states; not per frame.

Other hidden CLR boundaries: delegate invocation for note events (APU cores) and dynamic core switching using reflection; minor compared to interop but subject to micro-optimizations if still on hot path.

## 3. Ranked Optimization Opportunities (Highest Estimated Gain First)

### Tier A ‚Äì High Impact / Strategic
1. Replace per-frame `float[]` audio marshaling with SharedArrayBuffer + AudioWorklet (pull model) ‚Äì Prototype active; finalize managed writer + feature flag / fallback.
   - Estimated gain: 8‚Äì20% total frame time reduction & lower GC churn; smoother audio under load.
   - Rationale: Copying ~1‚Äì8 KB 60 times/second + scheduling JS each frame induces GC + blocking; AudioWorklet can read directly from a ring buffer in WASM memory (or a SharedArrayBuffer we fill via `Unsafe` span copy). Frees main thread and reduces latency jitter.
2. Zero/Low-Copy Framebuffer Transfer ‚Äì Rolled back (prototype removed). Revisit only if future perf profiling justifies reintroduction.
   - Estimated gain: 8‚Äì15% (depends on resolution and current copy cost). 
   - Strategy: Expose framebuffer as pinned `Span<byte>`; JS obtains a `Uint8Array` view into the WASM linear memory (via `Blazor.platform._memory` in legacy, or upcoming `dotnet.runtime.memory` APIs) and calls `texSubImage2D` with a typed array view; .NET stops sending the array parameter‚Äîonly signals dirty/ready (or JS drives the loop and reads directly each RAF).
3. Batch Note Events (SoundFont) into a per-frame ring buffer (single interop call) ‚Äì Not started.
   - Estimated gain: 5‚Äì12% (workload-dependent; spikes smoothed). 
   - Approach: Accumulate events in a preallocated struct array or unmanaged ring; at frame end (or audio tick), send count & maybe pointer. JS drains synchronously. Eliminates many small allocations + await overhead.
4. Invert Frame Loop Ownership (JS polls, .NET stays in compute loop) OR Coalesce Frame JS Calls ‚Äì Coalesced call DONE; loop inversion TBD (may defer pending new profiling).
   - Estimated gain: 4‚Äì8%. 
   - Option A: Keep `requestAnimationFrame` in JS but collapse `playAudio` + `drawFrame` + any metrics into one invoke (one boundary crossing vs two). Option B: Run continuous .NET loop (timed) and only call a single JS `present(framePtr,audioPtr,len,...)` method.

### Tier B ‚Äì Medium Impact
5. Unmarshalled Interop for Small Primitives (note events if not batching yet; packed input bitmask) ‚Äì Defer until batching + packed input implemented; may be unnecessary.
   - Gain: 2‚Äì5%. Use `IJSUnmarshalledRuntime` / .NET 8 `JSMarshaler` to avoid JSON/serializer overhead for primitive bursts while interim migrating to ring buffer.
6. Pack Controller State into a Single Byte ‚Äì Not started.
   - Gain: ~1‚Äì2% (micro) but reduces GC & simplifies `[JSInvokable] UpdateInput` path. Accepts `byte` bitmask instead of `bool[8]` (eight marshalled booleans currently). Combine with unmarshalled call or polling.
7. Reduce Async State Machine Allocations in Hot Path ‚Äì Partial; convert remaining frame loop methods to `ValueTask`.
   - Gain: 1‚Äì3%. Convert `FrameTick` to `ValueTask`, remove `async`/`await` in `RunFrame` where possible (synchronous path except when blasting). Fire-and-forget JS calls already used; ensure they are not capturing unnecessary state.
8. Pre-sized / Reused Buffers (Audio & Frame) with Manual Length Semantics ‚Äì Ongoing verification (ensure no hidden per-frame allocations remain).
   - Gain: 1‚Äì2%. Avoid new arrays if emulator already writes into stable buffers; ensure we do not allocate per frame (confirm via profiling). If currently producing a new `float[]`/`int[]` each call, reuse.

### Tier C ‚Äì Lower Impact / Polish
9. Deferred / Batched Preference Writes (debounce idbSetItem) ‚Äì quality of life; avoids extra micro stalls.
10. Collapse multiple shader registration invocations into a single JS bulk registration call (init only; reduces cold start). 
11. Replace `try{ JS.InvokeVoidAsync("eval", ...) }` with pre-bound function references (JIT/warm-up improvement; minor but cleaner security posture).
12. Remove double enumeration / LINQ overhead inside frame-critical sections (e.g., repeated `.Any()` in loops) ‚Äì negligible but cumulative.

## 4. Implementation Sketches

### 4.1 Shared Audio Ring (AudioWorklet)
1. Allocate SharedArrayBuffer (e.g., capacity for 4 √ó target chunk). Expose its ID/address to .NET once.
2. .NET writes PCM samples sequentially (interleaved or mono) and advances a write index (shared Int32 in a control SAB).
3. AudioWorkletProcessor pulls & schedules with low jitter, reading indices atomically.
4. Remove per-frame `playAudio` invoke; JS issues zero interop during steady-state.

### 4.2 Framebuffer Zero-Copy
Option (WebGL2):
```
Startup: JS obtains Uint8Array view of WASM memory at framebuffer address (provided via a one-time interop call). Each RAF: JS calls `gl.texSubImage2D` directly from that view. Only invalidation signal required (could poll a frame counter stored in a shared Int32).
```

### 4.3 Note Event Batching
```
struct NoteEvent { byte Channel; byte Program; byte Midi; byte Velocity; byte Flags; } // pack On bit into Flags
Preallocate NoteEvent[MaxPerFrame]. On event: write, increment count. End of frame: single JS call passing (pointer, count) OR JS polls count & copies into its own queue.
```

### 4.4 Packed Input
```
JS packs directional + buttons into one byte (bit per button) and calls `UpdateInputPacked(byte state)` OR writes shared Int32 and triggers nothing; .NET reads before emulation step.
```

### 4.5 Coalesced Present Call
```
present(framePtr, width,height, audioPtr, sampleCount, metaFlags)
```
JS then performs both texture upload + audio scheduling.

### 4.6 Remove Await in Frame Loop
`FrameTick()` returns `ValueTask` and internally calls synchronous `RunFrame()`; corruption (`Blast()`) can queue tasks but not await inside hot loop; UI updates throttled on a timer.

---

## 5. Estimation Rationale
Empirical data from similar Blazor WASM emulators indicates:
- Full-frame marshalled buffer copies (video+audio) can dominate ‚â•25‚Äì35% CPU in medium-performance devices.
- Cutting array marshaling to zero-copy typically halves that portion.
- Batching dozens of tiny invokes (note events) into one reduces overhead due to JS interop dispatch (~10‚Äì30 ¬µs each) + allocations (args array, task wrapper).
- Input packing saves small but recurring cost, helps GC locality.

---

## 6. Quick Wins (Do First)
1. Pack controller input to byte; add new `[JSInvokable] UpdateInputPacked(byte s)`; keep legacy for fallback.
2. Batch note events per frame (simple managed `List<NoteEvent>` + single interop call) before pursuing SAB.
3. Coalesce audio + video interop into single `presentFrame(frameBuf,audioBuf,sampleRate)` to immediately reduce calls from 2‚Üí1 per frame. (DONE)
4. Convert `FrameTick` to `ValueTask` & remove unnecessary awaits.
5. Debounce shader & preference JS calls (non-critical but trivial).

---

## 7. Medium-Term
1. Migrate audio to AudioWorklet + SharedArrayBuffer ring.
2. Implement zero-copy framebuffer (WebGL2 view) behind feature flag.
3. Replace batched note event invoke with shared memory polling (JS side scheduler reads events at audio tick cadence).
4. Introduce a single shared "interop command block" (struct with flags & offsets) polled by JS each RAF to eliminate inbound `[JSInvokable] FrameTick` (JS drives; .NET sets ready flag).

---

## 8. Long-Term / Stretch
1. Investigate WebGPU path (if available) for direct texture updates; may further reduce copy overhead vs Canvas.
2. Explore ahead-of-time (AOT) compile for critical cores (CPU/APU) to reduce CLR overhead; ensures optimization headroom once interop minimized.
3. Evaluate converting sound font synthesis fully to WASM (C# or Rust) to avoid note event JS path entirely (only final audio ring crosses boundary).
4. Consider moving persistence (IndexedDB operations) to a minimal worker with message batching to offload main thread (only after hot paths solved).

---

## 9. Measurement & Validation Plan
Metrics to collect before/after each phase:
- Frame time breakdown (Chrome Performance): % time in `dotnet.*` vs `nesInterop.*` vs GC.
- Interop call count per second (instrument wrappers).
- Audio glitch incidence (underruns) - expected to drop after SAB migration.
- Memory allocations per frame (Event listener, note events) via `dotnet counters` (if using WASM debug) or custom counters.

Instrumentation tasks:
1. Wrap `IJSRuntime.Invoke*` with counting decorator (DI) to log frequency.
2. Add frame counter & timestamp in shared memory for JS to compute latency.
3. Add optional env flag `?diagInterop=1` to enable verbose logging once per N frames.

Success criteria for Tier A:
- ‚â•15% reduction total CPU time on mid-tier device @ 60 FPS test ROM.
- No increase in dropped audio frames; ideally fewer.
- GC allocations per second reduced by ‚â•30%.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| SharedArrayBuffer requires COOP/COEP headers | SAB blocked | Already likely set for PWA; confirm headers in `index.html`/hosting config. Add fallback to legacy path. |
| AudioWorklet complexity / browser support | Delays | Progressive enhancement: keep existing path until worklet stable. |
| Race conditions when JS polls buffer | Visual/audio artifacts | Use atomic counters (Int32) & double-buffering strategy. |
| Increased code complexity | Maintainability | Centralize interop abstractions (e.g., `InteropChannels` class). |
| AOT size increase | Load time | Offer toggle build config; gate behind perf mode. |

2. Zero-copy Framebuffer (High)
3. Batched Note Events (High)

---

## 14. Appendix ‚Äì Implementation Hints
* Unmarshalled interop (legacy): cast to `IJSUnmarshalledRuntime` (only in WASM) for primitive spans; ensure fallback path on server prerender.
* Shared memory access: In modern .NET WASM, use `globalThis.getDotnetRuntime().getMemory()` (experimental) or maintain a small JS helper to locate the ArrayBuffer.
* Ensure GC safety: Pin managed buffers only while referencing from JS or allocate via `GCHandle.Alloc(..., GCHandleType.Pinned)`; unpin on dispose.
* Batch boundaries early‚Äîeven if zero-copy not ready‚Äîso later migration only swaps transport mechanism.

---

Prepared for: Performance tuning initiative to push frame stability & headroom for future features (e.g., advanced shaders, higher audio polyphony).

---

### Appendix: AudioWorklet Test Procedure (HotPot Early Validation)
1. Open app with dev tools console.
2. Start emulation; wait 2‚Äì3 seconds for ring to fill.
3. Run `nesInterop.audioDiag()` ‚Äì expect `{ enabled:true, failed:false, underruns:0 }` (underruns may spike briefly at start then stabilize).
4. Capture baseline (legacy path) by forcing fallback: temporarily set `window.nesInterop._awFailed=true` and refresh; compare CPU usage in Performance panel over 10s.
5. Measure:
   - Interop calls marked `playAudio` should disappear (search in performance flame graph).
   - GC pressure: fewer array allocations per frame.
6. Stress: enable fast-forward and ensure underruns remain near zero (acceptable occasional increment <1 per second). If sustained underruns, consider increasing capacity.
